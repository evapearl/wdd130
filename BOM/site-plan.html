        We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their hearts the message it contains, and then to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10:3-5.)

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        The Book of Mormon is a record of God's dealing with the ancient inhabitant of the America continent. It got it name from a prophet-historian named Mormon, who wrote and abridged together the plates of this Holy words written by different ancient prophets. These Holy words were written on goldplates in the language of these ancient inhabitant.The name Mormon means "More good, more righteousness". The history of this book link back to the Bible during the reign of king Zedekiah. It also contain the record of when the Lord confounded the tongues at the tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except for some called the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the american Indians. During the destruction of these nations, the Book was buried by Moroni, the son of Mormon to be brought forth in our days as revealed to him by God. At the due time The Book of Mormon was revealed and delivered to Joseph Smith who was prepared by the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being. Joseph Smith through the Holy Ghost translate the book to English language. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the son of the living God and that all who will come unto Him and obey the laws and ordinances of His gospel may be saved. Concerning this record the prophet Joseph Smith said "I told the brethren that The Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than any other book."
