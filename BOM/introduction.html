                <p>At the due time The Book of Mormon was revealed and delivered to Joseph Smith who was prepared by the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being. Joseph Smith through the Holy Ghost translate the book to English language. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the son of the living God and that all who will come unto Him and obey the laws and ordinances of His gospel may be saved. Concerning this record the prophet Joseph Smith said "I told the brethren that The Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than any other book."</p>
