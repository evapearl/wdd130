                    <h1>FAQ</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Book of Mormon contain 15 books which give answer to life challenging questions including:
                    </p>
                    <h2> What is the plan of salvation? </h2>
                    <p>Mosiah 4:6-8</p>
                    <p>"6. I say unto you, if ye have come to a aknowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless
                        power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and
                        also, the atonement which has been prepared from the foundation of the world, that thereby
                        salvation might come to him that should put his dtrust in the Lord, and should be diligent in
                        keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the
                        life of the mortal bodyâ€”
                        7. I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through the atonement which was prepared
                        from the foundation of the world for all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who
                        are, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.
                        8 And this is the means whereby salvation cometh. And there is none other salvation save this
                        which hath been spoken of; neither are there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the
                        conditions which I have told you."
                    </p>
                    <h2>Does it testify of Jesus Christ?</h2>
                    <p>2 Nephi 25:23,26</p>
                    <p>23. For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe
                        in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after
                        all we can do.</p>
                    <p>26. And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and
                        we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look
                        for a remission of their sins.
                    <h2>What is my purpose on earth?</h2>
                    <p> 32. For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of
                        this life is the day for men to perform their labors.
                        33. And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech
                        of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day
                        of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while
                        in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.
                        34. Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will
                        return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies
                        at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body
                        in that eternal world.</p>
