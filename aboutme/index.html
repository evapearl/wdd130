        <P>I am pursuing a degree on Applied Technology. BYU has been a huge support to my education. I love how it helps me balance my spiritual and physical life. I see a lot of advantages in taking this course. it will be helpful in creating a web site for my work. I am taking this course because I want to improve and develop myself for more oppotunities to come.</P>
        <p>Some of my hobbies are reading and spending time with children.</p>
        <p>I am a seamstress, I love making clothes, especially our traditional clothes here. I am also a teacher.</p> 
        <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day saints for 6 year. I have a favourite quote from one of the church leaders, Elder Dieter F. Uchdorf "Always remember you matter to Him". My favourite scripure is from the book of Helaman 5:12.</p>
